    "This is a capstone project for \"IBM Data Science Professional Certificate\" as a part of course \"Applied Data Science Capstone\". The capstone project is meant to define and solve a business problem leveraging Foursquare data, among other publicly available geo-data.\n",

    "Business Problem\n",
    "----\n",
    "Our customer would like to open an ice cream shop in New York City and needs us -the data consultant- to provide metrics and suggestions on where the best neighborhood is for such a shop. \n",
    "\n",
    "We define four metrics and break the project into four correspondent segments as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1- Segment One:</b> Rank boroughs in terms of total and youth population\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2- Segment Two:</b> Rank boroughs in terms of safety using shooting data as the base\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3- Segment Three:</b> Rank neighborhoods in terms of access by distance from a benchmark \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>4- Segment Four:</b> Rank neighborhoods in terms of existing ice cream shops parsing Foursquare data\n",
    "\n",
    "Segments one and two are used to determine the best borough. Segments three and four will refine the neighborhood data to find the best neighborhood.\n",

    "Data Requirement\n",
    "---\n",
    "Data that is used for segment one is <a href=\"https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/demographic-social-economic-and-housing-profiles-by-borough\">Demographic and Housing Profiles by Borough</a>. The data is sorted as an excel file which needs to be refined and prepared. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data that is used for segment two is <a href=\"https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic\">NYPD Shooting Incident Data</a>. The data is sorted as different formats including csv. \n",

    "Data for segment three is <a href=\"https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset\">New York Geo Data</a> as a json file. \n",

    "Segment four data is acquired through Foursquare as a json file that includes information about venues near specific locations. Tis section requires a Foursquare account and a customized URL which is provided in the relevant section. \n",
